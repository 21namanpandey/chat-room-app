## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the mobile application locally on an Android emulator or device.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** or **Yarn**
- **React Native CLI** development environment setup (Android Studio, SDKs, etc.). Refer to the [official React Native CLI documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for detailed setup.
- A running instance of the **Node.js Chat Backend** (ensure it's accessible from your mobile app, typically `http://10.0.2.2:3001` for Android emulator).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/21namanpandey/chat-room-app.git
   cd chat-room-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install CocoaPods (if you plan to run on iOS, optional for Android-only):

   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```

### Configuration (.env file)

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `chatMobileApp` directory and add the following environment variable:

```plaintext
API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3001
```

- **API_URL**: This is the URL for your Node.js backend.
  - For **Android Emulator**, `10.0.2.2` is the special alias for your host machine's localhost.
  - For a **physical Android device**, you'll need to use your host machine's actual IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.X:3001`).

### Running the Application (Android)

1. Start the Metro Bundler:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Run on Android device/emulator (in a new terminal tab/window):

   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

This will build the app and install it on your connected Android device or running emulator.
